IOT & ROBOTICS COMMUNITY

The Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) is a concept in which intelligent devices can monitor the events happening around them, fuse their sensor data, make use of local and distributed intelligence to decide on courses of action and then behave to manipulate or control objects in the physical world 2. Robotics technology has been evolving rapidly, and IoT has been playing a significant role in this evolution. The IoT and robotics communities are coming together to create the IoRT 2.

IoRT is an emerging field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology. It has applications in various domains such as manufacturing, agriculture, health, surveillance, education, and more 3. The integration of robotic agents and IoT leads to innovation in digital systems, which is drawing new possibilities in both industrial and research fields 3.

IoRT is important because it provides robots with wider situational awareness from IoT sensors and data analytics technologies, which leads to better task execution 2. It also enables robots to handle unexpected conditions that arise using artificial intelligence and machine learning 2.

In summary, IoRT is an emerging field that combines robotics technology with IoT. It has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology and has applications in various domains. It provides robots with wider situational awareness from IoT sensors and data analytics technologies, which leads to better task execution. It also enables robots to handle unexpected conditions that arise using artificial intelligence and machine learning.
